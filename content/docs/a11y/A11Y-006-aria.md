# A11Y-006 — ARIA

## Summary
ARIA fills semantic gaps when native HTML cannot express a custom widget; incorrect ARIA harms access.

## MUST
- A11Y-006.M1: Prefer native HTML and keep role/name/state synchronized with visible behavior.

## SHOULD
- A11Y-006.S1: Follow a published keyboard pattern for every custom widget.

## AVOID
- A11Y-006.A1: Do not conflict with native semantics or override visible labels without reason.

## DECIDE
| Situation | Decision |
|---|---|
| Native element fits | Use native semantics |
| Custom widget needed | Follow pattern and test |
| Scan passes | Continue manual review |

## STATES
- Default
- Keyboard
- Screen reader
- Zoom/reflow
- Error
- High contrast/reduced motion

## EXAMPLE
Disclosure button updates aria-expanded and controls its panel.

## FAILURE MODES
- A polished screen can still fail the task; validate against the defined user outcome.
- A heuristic is not a WCAG success criterion unless explicitly identified as one.
- If project context conflicts with this guidance, record the conflict and obtain an explicit decision.

## CHECK
- [ ] Native HTML considered?
- [ ] Role/name/state correct?
- [ ] Keyboard model complete?
