# DS-005 — Component Variants

## Summary
Variants express meaningful intent, hierarchy or state while keeping a predictable API.

## MUST
- DS-005.M1: Create variants for semantic roles such as primary, secondary, danger or quiet.

## SHOULD
- DS-005.S1: Separate state styling from variant intent.

## AVOID
- DS-005.A1: Do not create variants solely for arbitrary color/radius or page layout.

## DECIDE
| Situation | Decision |
|---|---|
| Repeated decision | Promote token/component |
| Unique workflow | Keep as pattern |
| Breaking change | Version and migration note |

## STATES
- Default
- Variants
- States
- Theme
- Responsive
- Deprecated

## EXAMPLE
Danger is variant; hover is state; full-width is layout.

## FAILURE MODES
- A polished screen can still fail the task; validate against the defined user outcome.
- A heuristic is not a WCAG success criterion unless explicitly identified as one.
- If project context conflicts with this guidance, record the conflict and obtain an explicit decision.

## CHECK
- [ ] Use case named?
- [ ] State separate?
- [ ] Invalid combos controlled?
