# EVAL-002 — Cognitive Load

## Summary
Cognitive-load review identifies avoidable working-memory, decision and interpretation burdens.

## MUST
- EVAL-002.M1: Externalize information users must compare or remember.

## SHOULD
- EVAL-002.S1: Group options and reveal complexity progressively without hiding essentials.

## AVOID
- EVAL-002.A1: Do not claim a universal maximum number of options.

## DECIDE
| Situation | Decision |
|---|---|
| Observed failure | Record evidence and severity |
| Potential risk | Validate with task test |
| Metric movement | Inspect definition and guardrails |

## STATES
- Task start
- Primary task
- Error/recovery
- Completion
- Repeat use

## EXAMPLE
Keep selected plan and billing cadence visible during checkout.

## FAILURE MODES
- A polished screen can still fail the task; validate against the defined user outcome.
- A heuristic is not a WCAG success criterion unless explicitly identified as one.
- If project context conflicts with this guidance, record the conflict and obtain an explicit decision.

## CHECK
- [ ] Recall minimized?
- [ ] Comparison supported?
- [ ] Terms understandable?
