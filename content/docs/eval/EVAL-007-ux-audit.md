# EVAL-007 — UX Audit

## Summary
A UX audit combines heuristic inspection, accessibility, analytics and user evidence to prioritize risks.

## MUST
- EVAL-007.M1: Audit critical journeys end-to-end including empty, error, permission, loading and responsive states.

## SHOULD
- EVAL-007.S1: Separate observed defect, inferred risk and untested hypothesis.

## AVOID
- EVAL-007.A1: Do not issue generic scores without scope, evidence and severity.

## DECIDE
| Situation | Decision |
|---|---|
| Observed failure | Record evidence and severity |
| Potential risk | Validate with task test |
| Metric movement | Inspect definition and guardrails |

## STATES
- Task start
- Primary task
- Error/recovery
- Completion
- Repeat use

## EXAMPLE
Audit sign-up through first value, not only the form.

## FAILURE MODES
- A polished screen can still fail the task; validate against the defined user outcome.
- A heuristic is not a WCAG success criterion unless explicitly identified as one.
- If project context conflicts with this guidance, record the conflict and obtain an explicit decision.

## CHECK
- [ ] Scope/journeys explicit?
- [ ] Evidence types distinct?
- [ ] Priority includes impact/reach?
