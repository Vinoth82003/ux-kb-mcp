# INT-001 — Interaction Design Principles

## Summary
Interactions need a discoverable trigger, visible response, predictable result and recovery.

## MUST
- INT-001.M1: For every action define trigger, feedback, resulting state and recovery path.

## SHOULD
- INT-001.S1: Make transitions visible and preserve user input on failure.

## AVOID
- INT-001.A1: Do not make motion, sound or hidden gestures the only way to operate a feature.

## DECIDE
| Situation | Decision |
|---|---|
| Immediate/reversible | Update and offer undo if useful |
| Asynchronous | Show honest progress |
| Irreversible | Explain before commit |

## STATES
- Idle
- Triggered
- Pending
- Success
- Failure
- Cancelled

## EXAMPLE
Save shows pending, success or failure rather than silently stopping.

## FAILURE MODES
- A polished screen can still fail the task; validate against the defined user outcome.
- A heuristic is not a WCAG success criterion unless explicitly identified as one.
- If project context conflicts with this guidance, record the conflict and obtain an explicit decision.

## CHECK
- [ ] Trigger/outcome clear?
- [ ] Feedback timing defined?
- [ ] Recovery path exists?
