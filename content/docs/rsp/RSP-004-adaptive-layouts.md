# RSP-004 — Adaptive Layouts

## Summary
Adaptive layouts switch patterns when a different arrangement is more usable than fluid resizing.

## MUST
- RSP-004.M1: Change pattern only when task constraints justify it.

## SHOULD
- RSP-004.S1: Keep content order, naming and action semantics consistent.

## AVOID
- RSP-004.A1: Do not remove data or change action meaning between variants.

## DECIDE
| Situation | Decision |
|---|---|
| Layout fits | Keep fluid |
| Content collides | Add breakpoint |
| Interaction changes | Test adaptive pattern |

## STATES
- Narrow
- Wide
- Zoom/reflow
- Orientation
- Touch/keyboard

## EXAMPLE
Mobile record view retains sort and all essential fields from desktop grid.

## FAILURE MODES
- A polished screen can still fail the task; validate against the defined user outcome.
- A heuristic is not a WCAG success criterion unless explicitly identified as one.
- If project context conflicts with this guidance, record the conflict and obtain an explicit decision.

## CHECK
- [ ] Task still achievable?
- [ ] Content parity documented?
- [ ] Alternate pattern tested?
