# SAAS-001 — Dashboards

## Summary
Dashboards support monitoring and decisions by prioritizing questions and actions.

## MUST
- SAAS-001.M1: Define audience, decisions and review cadence before selecting KPIs.

## SHOULD
- SAAS-001.S1: Show metric definition, time period, comparison baseline and freshness.

## AVOID
- SAAS-001.A1: Do not fill dashboards with vanity metrics or decorative charts.

## DECIDE
| Situation | Decision |
|---|---|
| Decision support | Prioritize metric/action |
| Setup incomplete | Offer minimum next step |
| High-risk billing action | Disclose consequence |

## STATES
- First use
- Populated
- Filtered empty
- No permission
- Stale/loading
- Error

## EXAMPLE
Finance dashboard surfaces overdue invoices before vanity totals.

## FAILURE MODES
- A polished screen can still fail the task; validate against the defined user outcome.
- A heuristic is not a WCAG success criterion unless explicitly identified as one.
- If project context conflicts with this guidance, record the conflict and obtain an explicit decision.

## CHECK
- [ ] Each metric answers question?
- [ ] Period/freshness visible?
- [ ] Next action clear?
